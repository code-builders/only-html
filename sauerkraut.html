      <p>Fermented foods have a long history in many cultures, with sauerkraut being one of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side dishes. It is a source of <strong>vitamins C, B, and K</strong>; the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more nutritious than the original cabbage.

      <h4>List of Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Medium/large cabbages - 2</li>
        <li>Medium carrots - 2-3</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt - 2 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 Tbsp</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Preparation steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the outermost leaves of the cabbage, cut it into quarters and shred the cabbage</li>
        <li>Shred the carrots</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, place cabbage, carrots; add sea salt and sugar. Knead it together really well for the juice to be released from the cabbage (4-5 min)</li>
        <li>Fill a glass jar with the cabbage mixture and pack it in very tightly so that the juice from the cabbage covers the cabbage completely. You want a jar big enough to be filled only about 2/3 full so it has room to expand.</li>
        <li>Make a press over the top of the cabbage by pushing down with a plate. Top with a small jar of water, a super clean rock or whatever else would make a good weight. Place the lid on the jar but do not tighten. Let stand at room temp for 4 days or until sour. It will stop fermenting when it's done.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To serve, drain the amount of cabbage that you would like to eat by firmly squeezing out the excess juice with your hands.
